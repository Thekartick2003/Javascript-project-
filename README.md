This is my metacraft project of javascript course.
In this project i have explained about the how the NFT variable holding my data and my metadata.
A variable has been created named as NFT to hold an array of NFTs object.
The mint NFT function is defined to create new NFT object with given meta data from user such as  basic information (name,uid,college_name,mobile_number).
I made another function named as The listNFTs which is used to iterate the mulitple NFTs arrays and the metadata of each NFT object to the console .
The gettotalsupply function is defined as to print the data to the console screen and also print the total number of NFTs in the array of the nfts.
ListNFT function is called to print the meta data of all provided NFTs object in  the NFT array.
the gettotalsupply function is called to print the total number of NFTs in the NFT array.
